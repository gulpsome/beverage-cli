# beverage-cli -- $ beve[rage]

*beverage is what you gulp*

## Why

Makes `gulp` more beverage-friendly.

## What

It's basically gulp with a couple of extra options and cleaner default help.
Can be used instead of gulp though it wasn't meant for that.

## Use

$ `npm i -g beverage-cli`

$ `beverage`

$ `beve` # same as the above, only shorter
