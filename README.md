# beverage-cli -- $ beve[rage]

*beverage is what you gulp*

## Why

Makes `gulp` more beverage-friendly.

## What

It's basically gulp with a couple of extra options and cleaner default help.
Can be used instead of gulp though it wasn't meant for that.

## Use

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/beverage-cli.png?compact=true)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/beverage-cli)

$ `npm i -g beverage-cli` #install --global

$ `beverage -?` # help

$ `beve` # same as the above, only shorter, matches `gulp`'s length
